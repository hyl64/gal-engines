# Engine versions and profiles

The games run the same engine in different builds, from ver 1.58 of 2005
to 1.669 of 2023.  One binary runs all of them: the differences between
the builds are kept in an engine profile (`inc/bgi/version.h`, `gEngine`)
selected once at start-up - from the game's `ipl._bp` through
`games.json`, from the command line (`--engine=NAME`, `--list-engines`;
`--productname=NAME` for the product name of a game `games.json` lacks),
the environment (`BGI_ENGINE=NAME`) or the launcher's dialog.  The
default is the build the reimplementation was verified against,
Tayutama ver 1.69 build 444.

Most differences between the builds are additional opcodes; which
opcodes a build defines is tabulated in `src/vm/opset.c` (generated from
a survey of 23 executables), and the VM's handler tables are filled at
start-up with the handlers of the selected generation (`Vm_FillTable`,
`src/vm/ops_base.c`).  A script using an opcode its engine did not have
gets the original's "undefined instruction" error; an opcode the engine
had but the reimplementation lacks yet gets a "not implemented" error
naming it.  A few differences are parameters of the virtual machine
itself that every pointer-handling service depends on - the layout of
the tagged script pointers and the size of the thread-local heap - and a
few more are behaviour switches inside the services ("1.529 on", "1.69
build 472 on" in the source comments), all keyed on the generation
(`EngineGen_t`, `GEN_1_58` .. `GEN_1_669`).

"compat" is the `Compatibility : x.xx` of the version resource (the
script-level compatibility the engine declares); the ver 1.58 .. 1.69
builds carry `ver x.xx ( build : n )` in their text instead.  Tayutama
(trial and retail) and TayutamaHD are the same engine version in three
builds: the retail game's build 451 is build 444 plus a dozen opcodes
that build 472 also has (see below), on the build 444 pointer layout.
Fortune Arterial's build 438 has the pointer layout of build 444 and a
subset of its opcodes (`74` `75` `90 53` `90 7A` `90 91` `90 B7` `91 B8`
`91 BA` came with 444), so it runs on profile `1.69/444`, which its
`games.json` entry names.  The three Yoake mae yori Ruri iro na builds
(August's Windows 10 release, its PS2 version and Moonlight Cradle) are
one engine build, 1.658.2, with the same opcode tables; they define
1.659's opcodes less `81 01` and have 1.659's picture-size table and its
eleven "91 9A" text functions, so they run on profile `1.659`, which
their `games.json` entries name.

The profile names of `--engine` are the version numbers of the table
without the minor build number (`1.69/444`, `1.69/451`, `1.69/472`, `1.529`, ...);
`--list-engines` prints them.

## games.json

The profiles and the games are built into the binary (`src/core/
version.c`) and written out as `games.json` the first time the engine
runs without one, next to the binary; from then on that file is what
the engine reads, so a profile can be adjusted or added and a game
recorded without rebuilding.  The file is looked for in the game's
directory first (a game may carry its own), then next to the binary;
`--games=PATH` or `BGI_GAMES=PATH` name another one.  Its own header
describes the format: `"profiles"` is a list of `{"name", "generation",
"compat", "tagShift", "tagCode", "tagData", "tagHeap", "dynFirst",
"dynCount", "heapLimit", "bootCode", "bootData"}` - the generation (one
of the built-in profiles' names) selects the opcode set and the
behaviour switches, the numbers are the virtual machine's parameters,
and a profile that leaves a number out takes its generation's built-in
value, so `{"name": "test", "generation": "1.553", "heapLimit":
8388608}` is a complete profile; `"games"` is the list of `{"match",
"profile", "product"}` entries described in the header, to which the
launcher adds `"directory"`, `"name"` and `"options"` for the games it
started.  A game without an entry runs with `--engine=NAME
--productname=NAME`: the product name is what its boot program compares
"80 E8" with, and a wrong one quits it at once.  When the file cannot be written (the binary runs from a
read-only place) the built-in lists serve in memory, silently.  A file
that lacks some of the built-in profiles (by name) or games (by match
string) - one an older build wrote - gets them appended in memory when
it is read, so a newer binary still detects every game it knows; the
file itself is rewritten only when the launcher records a game.

## File formats by version

Magic strings found in the executables: `PackFile` archives, `DSC FORMAT
1.00` compression and `bw` audio in every build; `CompressedBG___`
pictures from 1.64 on (1.58 has no CBG decoder) - version 1, the
lossless one of `src/core/cbg.c`, in every build with a decoder, and from
1.573 on version 2 as well (the word at +0x2E), the DCT codec of
`src/core/cbg2.c` that the backgrounds, event pictures and sprites of
Magical Charming!, Sekachu and the later games are stored in (the system
graphics stay version 1 / DSC); `BURIKO ARC20` archives
from 1.573 on next to `PackFile` (a 16-byte header - the 12-byte magic
and the entry count - then 0x80-byte entries: the name, lower-cased on
loading, at +0, the data offset at +0x60 and the size at +0x64, with the
data starting at 16 + count * 0x80); the
Visual Studio 2017 builds compare the archive magics as dword immediates
(`Pack` / `File`), so the strings no longer appear as text.  Loose file
names: `BGI.gdb` (the global database) everywhere, `BGI.hvl` from 1.66,
`.bss` from 1.653.  Ogg Vorbis is linked in every build.  The global
database has three layouts, all SDC-encoded: fixed sections with 0x1000
name slots up to 1.494, the same with 0x4000 name slots (and the flag
groups behind them) from 1.529 to 1.599, and "BURIKO GDB 3.00" from
1.616 on, sized sections with the names and flag groups of any number
and length; 1.529 on also read the other fixed layout, 1.616 on both
fixed ones, and each build writes its own.

## Tagged pointers

Script pointers are 32-bit values with an area tag in the top bits; the
layout changed twice, which every pointer-handling service and the
dynamic-block allocator ("80 20") depend on:

| builds | offset bits | global | code | data (locals) | local heap | dynamic blocks | heap limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.58 .. 1.66 | 24 | tag 0x00 | 0x11 | 0x10 | 0x12 | 0x40.. (tag - 0x40) | 16 MB |
| 1.69 builds 438 .. 451 (Fortune Arterial, Tayutama) | 25 | 0x00 | 0x08 | 0x09 | 0x0A | 0x10..0x3F (tag - 0x10) | 32 MB |
| 1.69 build 472 .. 1.669 | 26 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 16..63 (tag - 16); 4..15 are errors | 64 MB |

Compiled scripts embed such pointers - `syswnd._bp`
of Tayutama does `push32 0x20220400`, dynamic block 0 of the 1.69 build
444 layout - so the layout is part of the script ABI and a game needs the
profile of its own build.  The reimplementation keeps it in
`inc/bgi/version.h` (`gEngine`, `Engine_SelectProfile`).

## Structural changes between versions

* 1.69 build 451 (the retail Tayutama): the main table gains the `81`
  dispatcher ("未定義のシステム制御命令 $81%02X") with `81 10` and `81 1F`;
  `80 39` `80 6E` `90 F4..F6` `91 F0..F2` `B0 03` `B0 C0` appear and `80 80`
  takes its build 472 form (the database in the "80 39" directory, the
  window position in the database).  `90 F4` reads the file on the
  calling thread and `B0 03` pushes no result in this build.
* 1.69 build 472 (TayutamaHD): `43` (atan2 in 16.16 degrees), `50..54`
  (64-bit add / sub / mul / div / mod on pointer operands), `7E`; the
  pointer layout changes (above).
* 1.529 (DiamicDays): the second system family `81 xx` gets its first 21 opcodes.
* 1.535 (Gackoh): the `D0 xx` family appears (13 opcodes) and the main table
  gains the `D0` dispatcher.
* 1.588 (sekachu): first build with Visual Studio 2010; `D0 1C..1F` are
  replaced by `D0 17, 20..23, 28`; `76` of the main table is dropped; `E0`
  appears in the main table.
* 1.599 (unmei): link-time code generation (the handlers use a register
  calling convention for the VM helpers from here on; same source, different
  code shape).
* 1.616 (kodomo): `80 EC..EF` are dropped.
* 1.636 (senmomo, the trial of Sen no Hatou, Tsukisome no Kouki - an
  August game, the first of another maker in this survey): the base
  instruction set grows by nine opcodes `56..5F` (except 5C); `D0` gains 20
  opcodes (`40 41 60..6A 70 72 74 75 78..7A`); `80 EC..EE` return with
  another meaning, the plug-in DLLs of a game (below).  Its opcode set is
  that of 1.640 less `81 B9`, `90 CF`, `92 1B` and `92 31`; in between
  the two builds `90 11` and `A0 11` gained an error exit and the plug-in
  load began to hand the DLL the main window.
* 1.640 (Tayutama2AS): `81 B9`, `90 CF`, `92 1B`, `92 31`.
* 1.653 (WakabaironoQuartet): first Visual Studio 2017 build; the `E0 xx`
  family gets its own table (9 opcodes); the prohibited-opcode table appears.
* 1.667 (arcana): seventeen new base opcodes `0F 12 18..1F 2C..2F 3B 3C 73`;
  `7F` (a build-dependent debugging hook before: a no-op in most builds, a
  "検証結果" message box in 1.653) becomes a family dispatcher with a single
  opcode `7F 00` ("未定義のシステム制御命令 $7F%02X"); the conditional jump
  `15` reads an extra 16-bit immediate.

## What the reimplementation does about it

* The base instruction set 00..7E is stable from 1.58 to 1.662: no base
  opcode changes its argument protocol in that range (the only differences
  are the debugging opcodes 79..7B gaining message-box titles in 1.494 and
  7F, the build-dependent hook).  Versions only add: 67 / FF (1.66), 42 74
  75 (1.69), 81 (1.69 build 451), 43 50..54 7E (1.69 build 472), 77 7C (1.494), 66 (1.529),
  44 76 (1.573; 76 dropped again in 1.588), 64 65 (1.588), 56..5F (1.636),
  55 (1.653), 45 (1.654), 46 47 (1.662).  1.667 is the first break: the
  seventeen compact-encoding opcodes (`0F 12 18..1F 2C..2F 3B 3C 73`, with
  inline 8/16/32-bit immediates) and the conditional jump `15`, which
  reads an 8-bit condition and a 16-bit immediate before its operands.
  One VM core covers everything with a version switch for 1.667 on.
* The families only grow (the appendix lists every opcode with the version
  it appeared in), so the newest build's opcode set is a superset of
  every older one except for the few removed opcodes: `80 63` (1.64; the
  number is reused by a different handler from 1.69), `90 8A..8D` and
  `91 8F` (1.66), `92 37` (1.494), `76` (1.588), `D0 1C..1F` (1.588),
  `80 EC..EF` (1.616), `91 F4..F6` (1.653).  A reused number is the one
  case that needs a per-generation table entry (the `OpEntry_t` lists of
  `src/vm/ops_*.c` give every handler the range of generations it
  serves): `80 63` from 1.69, and `80 EC..EE` from 1.636 on, which load,
  free and call the plug-in DLLs of a game - a DLL of the game directory
  with an export "CallFunctionForEthornell" (1.640 on also
  "SetWindowHandleOfEthornell").  No plug-in can be loaded here; the three
  answer what the original does for a DLL that is not there (1 for the
  load, 3 "no such plug-in" for the others).
* The opcodes whose argument protocol or messages changed between builds
  have one handler per variant, again selected by generation: `80 64`
  `80 66` `90 10` `90 20..23` `90 5A` `90 5B` `91 98` (1.64); `90 56..5B`
  `90 87` `91 8C..8E` (1.66); `80 4C` (1.69); `80 80` (1.69/451); `90 F4`
  `B0 03` (1.69/472);
  `80 89..8B` `91 38` (1.494); `80 3A` `91 68` (1.529); `91 78 7A 7B`
  (1.535); `91 7B` (1.547); `81 29` (1.573); `80 25` `D0 15` `D0 16`
  (1.588); `80 DC` `D0 28` (1.599); `92 1E` (1.636); `90 11` `A0 11` (1.640);
  `80 B0 B1 B4 B5 B6` (1.653); `15` (1.667).
* Changes inside the services the handlers call (file formats, the
  renderer, the sound library) are handled where they occur, with a
  comment naming the build that introduced them.  Some that every script
  sees: from 1.529 on a display priority (and the fixed input layer of
  the text output) may be 0 .. 0xFFFF where 1.69 takes 0 .. 0xFFF, and
  the hit stand-in of a panel's button is as visible as the window it is
  attached to, whatever its own show flag says (a panel built while its
  window was faded out answers clicks once the window fades in); from
  1.535 on the engine's clock (`80 04`, every wait and timer) stops while
  the window is inactive when `81 68` asks for that, and from 1.547 on
  also while a message box or a dialog is up, the playing sounds being
  held with it; from 1.573 on the clock does not see jumps either - it
  starts at 0 and a step back, or one longer than 500 ms (`81 04` sets the
  limit from 1.616 on), is left out, so a long load or a stall does not
  count as time that passed.  From 1.547 on `81 6A` makes a fatal script
  error end only the thread that raised it: the first error's message is
  kept for `81 6B` and event -1 tells the scripts.
* Not every opcode of the later builds has a handler yet (`--list-missing`
  prints the gaps of a profile).  Of the ones the system programs of the
  games use, only `81 B0` / `81 B7` (1.573 on, the string distance the
  `recoveryrip._bp` of Magical Charming! computes) are known to be
  missing; the system programs of the Lump of Sugar games use no other
  missing one - a full dump of the 1.669 trial's programs
  (`bgidump`) reaches no opcode without a handler, so the missing ones are
  features of builds whose data has not been seen.  A missing opcode stops
  the game with "not implemented" naming it; please report the program and
  the opcode.  The macOS (darwin) port of this tree fills some of the
  former placeholders: `90 5D` (1.588 on) now renders the 3-D sprite - the
  rotations about X, Y and Z are projected with a perspective homography
  (see src/gfx/blit_persp.c; the scene-select screens of 1.653 on pass 0
  for all three, which is still the flat "90 5C" picture); `B0 8C` (1.616
  on) asks the OS layer (OS_DialogSelect) for the list-selection dialog, and
  the darwin back end draws it; the video textures of "91 F0 .. F7" / "92 F2
  .. F5" play BF_Movie type 0 files from an archive (src/gfx/vidtex.c); and
  "92 F0", a movie out of an archive, is unpacked for the ffmpeg player.
  `81 6C` (1.669), the renderer's output size, is still stored only: the
  picture keeps the size of the display mode.
* Sen no Hatou, Tsukisome no Kouki (1.636, the trial) is the first game of
  another maker the engine has been pointed at, and its system programs
  use much more of the engine than the Lump of Sugar ones.  Those its
  boot needs have handlers now (the gamepad keys `81 1B`, the stopped
  clock `81 68`, the kept errors `81 6A` / `81 6B`, the aspect-keeping
  bicubic fit `90 CA`, and `81 3C`, which makes the engine read an
  archive's index again - the title calls it for every theme archive
  `data10000.arc` .. `data10031.arc` it finds; and `81 44`, the thread the
  scenario driver starts for its icon manager in parts of its own code
  and data areas, with its heap shared - see docs/vm.md).  The rest that
  its programs use have handlers too, so that none of its archives holds
  a program with an opcode the engine lacks: the music channels' and
  sound effects' own volumes (`A0 1C`, `A0 2C`), a sound effect played
  faster at the same pitch (`A0 27`, the voice speed) and the length it
  then has (`A0 2F`), a bitmap shaped like a picture file (`90 C0`), a
  half-size copy (`90 C3`, the save thumbnails), picture files outside
  the archives in and out (`90 C4`, `90 C5`: BMP, PNG, JPEG and GIF in,
  BMP, JPEG and PNG out, where the original hands them to GDI+; the
  screenshots are JPEG), an object's "hidden" switch (`91 31`), moving
  a file (`80 27`), a file accessor (`81 28 .. 2B`), a file dialog with
  several filters (`81 38`), merging another copy of the global database
  (`81 80`), a two-field dialog with digits-only fields (`B0 87`) and the
  glyph width of the text-entry font (`B0 22`).  With its `sysprg.arc`,
  `system.arc` and `sysgrp.arc` it boots to the title screen, which then
  asks for the program "titlemovie" of the game's other archives.  A fan
  translation's boot program - a loose `ipl._bp` next to `system.arc`,
  which is read instead of the archive's - boots the same way: its
  search directories (`80 37`, `Patch\Scripts` and the like) are looked
  in for loose files before the archives, and its `B0 C3` for a font
  file that no archive holds (to fall back to other faces) answers 0, as
  in every build since 1.494, where it used to stop with the loader's
  "does not exist" error.  Its title loads files into blocks of the
  size "80 35" reports; that is the size of the decoded data, and from
  1.69 build 472 on "80 30" (LoadFile) reads a file through a buffer of
  its own and leaves only the decoded data in the caller's, so a DSC
  file whose stored form is the larger one fits (the loader used to
  read it whole into the block first and wrote past it).  The boot
  thread has 8 MB of code area and 4 MB of data area from this build
  on, not from 1.653.  The trial's boot program also starts
  `ISESUforSHTK.exe`, the game's first-run screen-settings tool (window or
  full screen, 16:9 or 4:3, 1280x720 / 1024x576 / 960x540), and reads its
  answers from `ISEforSHTK.dat`; when the tool cannot run (any system but
  Windows) nothing is written and the program keeps its defaults
  (windowed, 16:9, 1280x720), so the tool is not needed.

## Appendix: every opcode with the version it first appears in

Per family, the defined opcodes of the newest build (1.669) and of all the
